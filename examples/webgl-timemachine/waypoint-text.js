These green areas could be places of residence, golf courses, parks, or other people populated areas. As Las Vegas grows part of the Colorado River, Lake Mead shrinks.  People in Las Vegas use Lake Mead both as a water supply and to grow food."

You can see it’s a very desert area here in Northern Iran. If you look very closely, you’ll also see green areas right next to Lake Urmia and these are green areas where food is being grown. These are agricultural areas and it turns out the water that used to go into feeding lake Urmia from the rivers is being diverted into these areas for growing food. This is an overuse of water that can’t be sustained long term.  "

    "text" : "As the world’s appetite for food continues to increase, we start growing food in places that have a lot of water already. Let’s go now to the Amazon Rainforest in the Brazilian state of Rondonia.Notice here in the year 1984 that the land starts off almost entirely dark green. All that dark green is rainforest, but if you look closely you can also see faint lines cutting through the forest. Those are the beginnings of roads. You can see over the 30 year period, Now if we move forward about ten years, we begin to see lots more roads growing and we see the lighter patches of green where people are beginning to farm land.  If we jump all the way to 2015, we can see that this entire area has been turned into farmland. And this isn’t because Brazil itself has gotten a lot more hungry. Most of this farming is to support soybeans and grazing cattle for beef and soy that are being exported to the rest of the world. So now we’re looking at 1,000 kilometers east to west. This is the entire Brazilian state of Rondonia. If we zoom out enough, we can see the entire Amazon Rainforest east to west and even the Amazon river."
